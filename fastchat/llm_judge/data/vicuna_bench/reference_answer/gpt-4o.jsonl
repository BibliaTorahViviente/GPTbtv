The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Using dynamic programming, we can efficiently compute the nth Fibonacci number by storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nHere is a Python program to find the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Base cases\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Create an array to store Fibonacci numbers\n    fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers\n    fib[0] = 0\n    fib[1] = 1\n    \n    # Compute the Fibonacci numbers from 2 to n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]\n    \n    return fib[n]\n\n# Example usage\nn = 10\nprint(f\"The {n}th Fibonacci number is: {fibonacci(n)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base Cases**: The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1 and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number.\n2. **Array Initialization**: An array `fib` of size `n + 1` is created to store the Fibonacci numbers.\n3. **Initial Values**: The first two Fibonacci numbers, `fib[0]` and `fib[1]`, are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.\n4. **Dynamic Programming Loop**: A loop runs from 2 to `n`, filling in the array with the sum of the two preceding numbers.\n5. **Result**: The nth Fibonacci number is returned from the array.\n\nThis approach ensures that each Fibonacci number is computed only once, resulting in a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\) and a space complexity of \\(O(n)\\).

This formula helps to avoid potential overflow issues that can occur with large indices.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - If `arr[mid]` is equal to the `target`, we have found the element and return the index `mid`.\n   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the `target`, it means the target must be in the right half of the array, so we update `left` to `mid + 1`.\n   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the `target`, it means the target must be in the left half of the array, so we update `right` to `mid - 1`.\n\n5. **Not Found**: If the loop exits without finding the target, we return `-1` to indicate that the target is not present in the array.\n\nThis implementation ensures an efficient search with a time complexity of \\(O(\\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the array."]}], "tstamp": 1718303511.151012}
