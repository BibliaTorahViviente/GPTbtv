The code structure is poor, with no clear separation of concerns or use of functions. The code is also inefficient, as it simply counts the number of lines in the file rather than searching for the specific word. The use of comments is minimal and does not adequately explain the code's logic or functionality. The code also lacks error handling for cases where the file fails to open or the search word is not found.

The use of a 2D array to store the lengths of LCS is a standard approach, and the backtracking process to construct the LCS is well explained. The only minor issue is that the function does not handle cases where either of the input strings is empty.
