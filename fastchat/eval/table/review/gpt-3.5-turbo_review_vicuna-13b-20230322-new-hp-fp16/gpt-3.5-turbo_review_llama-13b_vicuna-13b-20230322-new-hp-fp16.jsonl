It would be helpful to add comments to explain the purpose of each step in the algorithm.\n\nAssistant 2's solution is also correct and efficient, and includes helpful comments that explain the logic behind the implementation. However, there are a few minor issues with the code structure. For example, the `dequeue` method should first check if the `out_stack` is empty before popping an element from it. Additionally, the `is_empty` method should check if both the `in_stack` and `out_stack` are empty, rather than just the `in_queue`.
