Additionally, the use of underscores in variable names (`str1` and `str2`) is not consistent with Python's naming conventions, which recommend using lowercase letters and underscores to separate words in variable names.\n\nOverall, both assistants have provided high-quality implementations of the algorithm, and their code is well-structured and easy to read.", "score": [9, 8]}

The implementation is efficient, as it uses only two data structures, and the time complexity of the enqueue, dequeue, and other operations is O(1). The only minor issue with the code is that the `__contains__` method is not implemented correctly, as it only checks for elements in the `in_stack` and not in the `out_stack`.\n\nAssistant 2's implementation is also clear and easy to understand, but it is less efficient than Assistant 1's implementation. The code is well-structured, and the comments are helpful in explaining the code's functionality. However, the implementation is based on the assumption that the stacks are always full, which is not always the case. Additionally, the dequeue operation is slower than the enqueue operation, which can lead to performance issues in certain situations.
